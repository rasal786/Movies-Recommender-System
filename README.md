üé¨ Movie Recommender System

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user preferences using machine learning techniques and natural language processing. Built as part of an internship project to understand recommendation algorithms and data-driven application development.


------------------------------------------------

üìå INTERNSHIP TASK OVERVIEW 

As part of this internship, I worked on developing a fully functional movie recommender system. Below are the key tasks I completed:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Loaded and cleaned movie metadata from CSV files (genres, cast, crew, overview, keywords, etc.).



2. Feature Engineering

Combined important features into a single text format for vectorization (e.g., overview, cast, genres, director).



3. Vectorization & Similarity Scoring

Converted text data into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer and calculated cosine similarity between movies.



4. Recommendation Logic Development

Implemented logic to return the top 10 similar movies for any given movie input.



5. Web Interface with Streamlit

Developed a clean, interactive user interface to test recommendations in real time.
