# Movies-Recommender-System
Features:
1. Movie selection via a simple dropdown
2. Machine Learning-based recommendation using a similarity matrix
3. Movie posters fetched live using the TMDB API
4. Top 5 recommendations shown with names and visuals
5. Clean, responsive Ul with Streamlit
Built with:
Python, Pandas, Streamlit, TMDB API, Machine Learning (cosine similarity matrix)
Why I did this?
Wanted to dive deeper into real-world recommendation systems and practice building interactive apps. It was exciting to combine APIs, machine learning concepts, and Ul building all in one project.
It's currently running locally, but I plan to deploy it soon!
Leamed a lot-similarity-based recommendations, API integration, and building usable, interactive interfaces.
Would love your feedback or your favorite movie recommendations!
