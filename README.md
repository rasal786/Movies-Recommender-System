MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.

The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.

Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

Features:
1. Movie selection via a simple dropdown
2. Machine Learning-based recommendation using a similarity matrix
3. Movie posters fetched live using the TMDB API
4. Top 5 recommendations shown with names and visuals
5. Clean, responsive Ul with Streamlit
Built with:
Python, Pandas, Streamlit, TMDB API, Machine Learning (cosine similarity matrix)
Why I did this?
Wanted to dive deeper into real-world recommendation systems and practice building interactive apps. It was exciting to combine APIs, machine learning concepts, and Ul building all in one project.
It's currently running locally, but I plan to deploy it soon!
Leamed a lot-similarity-based recommendations, API integration, and building usable, interactive interfaces.
Would love your feedback or your favorite movie recommendations!
